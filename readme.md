## Module

- Reusable piece of code that **encapsulates** implementation details;
- Usually a **standalone file,** but it doesn't have to be.
- **Compose software:** Modules are small building blocks that we put together to build complex applications;
- **Isolate components:** Modules can be developed in isolation without thinking about the entire codebase;
- **Abstract code:** Implement low-level code in modules and import these abstractions into other modules;
- **Organized code:** Modules naturally lead to a more organized codebase;
- **Reuse code:** Modules allow us to easily reuse the same code, even across multiple projects.
